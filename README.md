Planning
------

### Day 0 Planning Meeting
**GOAL:** Consensus on requirements, back-end schema, and scope (i.e. MVP vs. Stretch)
* Reviewed user-stories to determine scope
* Created a wireframe and ERD
* Brainstormed stretch goals
* Determined schedule for daily Scrums and "sprints"
  - Scrum stand-ups three times daily
* Agreed to Use ZenHub for project management

### Day 1 Planning Meeting
**GOAL:** Breakdown scope into tasks, assign work, and document in ZenHub
* Categorized objectives into Back-End, Front-End, and Stretch Goal epics
* Set milestones (i.e. sprints) based on day:
  - Day 1 = Back-End
  - Day 2 = Front-End
  - Day 3+ = Front-End Styling + Stretch Goals

### Day 2 Planning Meeting
**GOAL:** Revisit tasks, review schedule
* Whiteboarded all objectives
* Reviewed which had been completed updated ZenHub accordingly
* Work assigned

### Day 3 Planning Meeting
**GOAL:** Highlight remaining MVP requirements, assess stretch Goals
* Whiteboarded reamining objectives
* Work assigned

Process
------
* Stand-ups at beginning, middle, and end of the day.
* Heavily utilized pair and group programming with rotating leaders
* Kept a running list of outstanding tasks to tackle
* Used curl scripts to test API before creating and styling HTML forms
* Methodically worked on code feature-by-feature
* Tested code thoroughly after each new feature was added (TDD)
* Reviewed each pull request as a group to avoid merge conflicts

Problem-Solving Strategy
------

* Utilized online resources such as StackOverflow to investigate ways to resolve issues
* Pinpointed issues by using debugger and console.log
* Discussed and resolved code issues among group members
* Worked together as much as possible through pair and group programming
* Submitted inquiries to the General Assembly Project Issue queue to request assistance from instructors

Plans for Future Improvements
------
* Improve UI to make the application more intuitive and improve user experience
* Display aggregate survey results in charts
* Each survey dislayed as a link which will open survey on its own page
* Search Surveys by Title
* Front-End Validation
  - One Response per User per Survey
  - Cannot delete Surveys which have Responses
  - Cannot delete Options which have Responses
* Back-End Validation
  - One Response per User per Survey
  - Limit 1 Response per User per Survey
  - Limit 10 Options per Survey
  - Delete Surveys also deletes dependencies (Options and Responses)
